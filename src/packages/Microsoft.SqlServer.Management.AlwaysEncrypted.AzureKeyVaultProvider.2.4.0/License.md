1. __INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.__ One user may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices to design, develop and test your programs.
2.  __INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.__ Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.  You may not use these devices in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them.  You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.
3. __ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.__

           - You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
           - Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.

·         add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;
           - for any Distributable Code having a filename extension of .lib, distribute only the results of running such Distributable Code through a linker with your program;

           - modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that
             - the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
             - others have the right to modify it.
4. __SCOPE OF LICENSE.__ The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.

Cette limitation concerne :
- toute affaire liée au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers et
- les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

Elle s’applique également même si Microsoft connaissait l'éventualité d'un tel dommage. La limitation ou exclusion ci-dessus peut également ne pas vous être applicable, car votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit.
